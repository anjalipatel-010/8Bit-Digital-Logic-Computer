# 8Bit-Digital-Logic-Computer.
This is a basic 8-bit computer made using simple digital circuits. It shows how computers work using parts like logic gates, registers, and memory. It is a great  project to learn  digital electronics and how data is processed and instructions are run—step by step, bit by bit.
An 8-bit computer is a simple computing system where data • Emitter (E) – where current flows inThere are two types of BJTs:is processed in 8-bit chunks, meaning the arithmetic logic unit • NPN – Most commonly used in digital logic(ALU), registers, and data bus all handle 8-bit values.
It • PNP – Not used commonlyconsists of several essential components working together to In digital circuits, we mostly use NPN transistors, execute instructions. At its core, the clock circuit provides where:timing signals to synchronize operations, often controlled by a manual button for debugging or an oscillator for continuous • A small current into the base allows a much execution. The registers, including the accumulator (A), larger current to flow from collector to instruction register (IR), and program counter (PC), emitter.temporarily store and manage data during computation. The • When base current is applied → transistor is ALU performs basic arithmetic and logic operations, such as ON (saturation mode).addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR, directly • When base current is absent → transistor is manipulating 8-bit values.OFF (cutoff mode).The control unit is responsible for decoding instructions and This switching behavior allows BJTs to represent binary 1 (on) and 0 (off) states.coordinating the activities of different components, following BJTs can be arranged with resistors to form logic gates. the fetch-decode-execute cycle. Memory is divided into Below is a breakdown of how common gates (NAND)are RAM, which stores temporary data and running programs, and built using NPN transistors:ROM, which holds permanent instructions like a bootloader or microcode. The bus system allows communication between Here in Fig-1 shown how we can from a NAND gate these components, with the data bus transferring data, the using the BJT transistor; A NAND gate using two NPN address bus selecting memory locations, and the control bus bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) operates by arranging managing read and write operations. Input and output (I/O) the transistors in series between the output and ground. devices, such as switches, LEDs, and displays, provide The base of each transistor is connected to one of the interaction with the user.input signals (A and B), and the collector of the first The computer operates by fetching an instruction from memory, decoding it in the control unit, executing it in the ALU or other relevant components, and then repeating the cycle. Building an 8-bit computer on a breadboard involves using simple logic chips like the 74LS series, along with EEPROMfor storing microcode and SRAM for memory. A manual clock can be used for step-by-step debugging, while an oscillator allows continuous program execution.
