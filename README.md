# üñ•Ô∏è 8-Bit Digital Logic Computer

This repository showcases the design and construction of a fundamental 8-bit computer built using basic digital circuits. It's an excellent resource for learning about digital electronics, computer architecture, and how data is processed and instructions are executed‚Äîbit by bit.

## üìò Overview

An 8-bit computer processes data in 8-bit chunks, meaning its Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), registers, and data bus all handle 8-bit values. The system operates through the fetch-decode-execute cycle, where:

* **Clock Circuit**: Provides timing signals to synchronize operations.
* **Registers**: Temporarily store and manage data during computation.
* **ALU**: Performs basic arithmetic and logic operations like addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR.
* **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and coordinates the activities of different components.
* **Memory**: Divided into RAM (stores temporary data) and ROM (holds permanent instructions).
* **Bus System**: Allows communication between components, with the data bus transferring data, the address bus selecting memory locations, and the control bus managing read and write operations.
* **I/O Devices**: Provide interaction with the user.

## üß† Key Components

### 1. **Registers**

* **Accumulator (A)**: Stores intermediate results.
* **Instruction Register (IR)**: Holds the current instruction.
* **Program Counter (PC)**: Keeps track of the next instruction to execute.

### 2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**

* Performs operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and XOR on 8-bit values.

### 3. **Control Unit**

* Decodes instructions and generates control signals to coordinate the operation of the computer.

### 4. **Memory**

* **RAM**: Stores temporary data and running programs.
* **ROM**: Holds permanent instructions like a bootloader or microcode.

### 5. **Bus System**

* **Data Bus**: Transfers data between components.
* **Address Bus**: Selects memory locations.
* **Control Bus**: Manages read and write operations.

### 6. **Input/Output Devices**

* Devices like switches, LEDs, and displays that provide interaction with the user.

## üîß Building the Computer

Constructing this 8-bit computer involves using simple logic chips, such as the 74LS series, along with EEPROM for storing microcode and SRAM for memory. A manual clock can be used for step-by-step debugging, while an oscillator allows continuous program execution.
